{"name":"Hello World.  My name is Robert Sosebee","tagline":"","body":"### So you came here to look me up?\r\nWell Hi!  I'm an outdoor enthusiast who loves to code.  I will add some cool outdoorsy helpful applications for the Android Store and Windows Marketplace to @eebesos's account.  Apps for hiking, biking, canoeing, tennis...etc.  Maybe I'll consider using Xamarin to build iOS apps also.  I'll hopefully offer some cool code that you can fork! \r\n\r\n### Work Experience\r\nTeam Development Manager - [Assurance Systems, Inc.](http://accuagency.com)\r\n\r\nSoftware Engineer - [Assurance Systems, Inc.](http://.accuagency.com)\r\n\r\nFloor Supervisor - [Nike, Inc.](http://news.nike.com/)\r\n\r\nIntern - [Daystar Digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DayStar_Digital)\r\n\r\n### Education\r\nB.S Computer Science - [University of North Georgia](http://ung.edu/)\r\n\r\nProject Management Fundamentals Certificate - [University of Georgia](http://www.georgiacenter.uga.edu/)\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-73727788-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
